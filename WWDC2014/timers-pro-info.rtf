\f0\b\fs28 \cf0 Timers Pro is a sleek and minimal timers app for a diverse range of workouts. It has gained a lot of traction within the cross fit community. Reebok's CrossFit Open 2012 and 2013 videos use the app to time and score their athletes.\

This app is actually how I met the person who I worked with for Workout Hero and USAlliance. Anyways, like Workout Hero, I am the lead developer for this app. I am in charge of developing new timers with robust interfaces. }
