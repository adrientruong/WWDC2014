\f0\b\fs28 \cf0 In April 2013, I was contacted about building an app for a company. USAlliance to be specific, a big insurance company in Kansas. They wanted an app to enhance the interaction between customers and sales agents.\
\
Over 3 months, I collaborated with the company and a partner of mine to create a simple, easy-to-use iPad app that would become the entry point for new customers. Agents can now easily collect information from clients and generate, print, and submit applications. Not only is it easier, it is faster. This app is now installed on all the company's iPads and I continue to maintain the app today.}
