\f0\fs28 \cf0 Guess Dat Song is a music quiz that can be played alone or in versus mode. It plays a part of a song and users try to guess. It uses music found in the user's library or it can stream from iTunes top lists.\

This app was one of my first freelance gigs. I was responsible for implementing the core quiz functionality and the versus mode. Upon completion, the company liked my work and promptly asked me to develop the Mac version of this app. I am no longer involved in the development of this app but it has since accrued more than 2 million downloads.}
