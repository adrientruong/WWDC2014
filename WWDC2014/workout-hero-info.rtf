In 2011, I was tasked with fixing a couple of bugs. While doing so, I noticed the UI was lacking and the underlying API's used would not scale with the growth of the app. After a couple of months, I became the lead developer and rebuilt the app from the ground up. Workout Hero has been a part of my life for 2.5 years now and I'm blessed to be able to design and develop an app used by thousands of users daily.}
